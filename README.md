## About
One of my Semester-end projects.
It is like Pacman in functionality.

The focus of this project was to strictly adhere to my Professor's requirements.
So, don't expect a complete game.

## Assembly Instructions

- Use x86 MASM and also set up Irvine
- I lost the folder to the sounds so either give your own path to the sound, or remove the sound from the code before running it.

That's it!
